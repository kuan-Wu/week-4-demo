            <p>My name is Kuan-Wu Pan. Currently study at <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. I come from a sunshine island which is Taiwan, so the winter in Canada is really cold for me. However, it doesn't matter, because I like to wear coats and boots which are suitable to wear in the cold weather in Canada.</p> 
            <p>The reason I came to Ottawa was to follow my parents who need to be sent to work abroad. Therefore, less than a year ago at March 1<sup>st</sup> I have taken a leave of absence from my college in Taiwan. Before I came to Ottawa, I was originally studied Department of Foreign Languages.</p>
